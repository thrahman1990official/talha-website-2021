        Hands-on, tech-savy, fast-learner, double-Bachelors in Honors Electrical Engineering and General Computer Science from the University of Windsor in Canada. Currently seeking 
        new opportunities within the fields of Engineering & Information Technology. I have Test Engineering and Systems Analyst experience in the semiconductor, banking, computer, 
        and automotive industry. In university, while pursuing Electrical Engineering, I have worked with VHDL, C++, Matlab; while pursuing Computer Science, I primarily worked with 
        object-oriented languages such as C programming with Raptor, Java, bash-scripting on linux; front-end web-development languages such as HTML5, PHP, JavaScript; database languages
        such as MySQL. My goal is to be successful in the Engineering & IT field by starting out as an Test Engineer or Systems Analyst with skills I learned during my education,
        internship and contract-work experience, and in the future possibly learning game-development on the side. Outside of technology, I have interests in travelling, canoeing, soccer,
        drawing, calligraphy, lifting weights, modifying cars and bikes. I have lived most of my life in North America, both in Canada and United States, but I have also lived in South-Asia 
        and Middle-East, making me a multi-cultural individual. Other than being passionate about the Software field as a career and hobby, I like the fact that it has the flexibility of 
        working both on-site and remotely, as well as opportunities being global.
