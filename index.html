        <br>
        Hands-on, tech-savy, fast-leaner, double-bachelors in computer science & electrical engineering from the University of Windsor in Canada. Currently seeking 
        new opportunities within the field of computer science & electrical engineering. I have information technology experience in the banking, computer, and 
        automotive industry. In university, while pursuing Electrical Engineering, I have worked with VHDL, C++, Matlab; while pursuing Computer Science, I primarily 
        worked with with object-oriented languages such as C programming with Raptor, Java, bash-scripting on linux; front-end web-development languages such as 
        HTML5, PHP, JavaScript; database languages suchas MySQL. My goal is to be successful in the IT field by starting off in the full-stack web-development field,
        by becoming expert, and eventually after a couple of years gaining experience, I will move towards the direction of blockchain development. Outside of 
        technology, I have interests in travelling, canoeing, soccer, drawing, calligraphy, lifting weights, modifying cars and bikes. I have lived most of my life 
        in North America, both in Canada and United States, but I have also lived in South-Asia and Middle-East, making me a multi-cultural individual. Other than 
        being passionate about the Software field as a career and hobby, I like the fact that it has the flexibility of working both on-site and remotely, as well as opportunities being global.
